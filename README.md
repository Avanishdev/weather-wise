# Weather App Project

This project is a weather application that allows users to view weather data for different cities, save favorite cities, and access five-day weather forecasts. It utilizes React on the frontend and JSON Server as a mock backend to store favorite cities.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **JSON Server**: This project uses JSON Server as a mock backend to store favorite city data.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL of your Git repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   After cloning, move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd weather-wise
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all required dependencies for the frontend application by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all packages listed in the package.json file.

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow the steps below. Youâ€™ll need two terminals: one for the React frontend and one for JSON Server.

### Step 1: Create Environment Variables

In the root directory of the project, create a `.env` file to store the API keys and URLs. Add the following content to your `.env` file:

```plaintext
REACT_APP_API_KEY=d697e316da1141f5b5aa24412fcc19e7
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5
REACT_APP_JSON_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

These environment variables will be used for accessing the OpenWeather API and JSON Server.

### Step 2: Start JSON Server

In a **new terminal**:

1.  Navigate to the `src` directory of your project:

    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

2.  Start JSON Server to simulate a backend, using db.json as the database file. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
    ```

This command will start JSON Server on http://localhost:3001, where it will watch for changes in db.json and automatically reload.

### Step 3: Start the Frontend (React)

**In your original terminal**:

1. Make sure you are in the main project directory (weather-wise), and then start the React application with:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The app should open automatically in your default browser at http://localhost:3000. If it doesnâ€™t, you can manually open this URL in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Search Weather by City**: Enter the name of a city to get current weather and a 5-day forecast.
2. **Add to Favorites**: Click "Add to Favorites" to save a city's weather data to your favorites list.
3. **View Favorites**: Access your favorite cities and quickly see their weather. Click on any favorite city to view detailed weather information.
4. **Remove from Favorites**: Click "Remove" to delete a city from your favorites list.

## Additional Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that the `.env` file is correctly configured with your API keys and URLs:

  ```plaintext
  REACT_APP_API_KEY=d697e316da1141f5b5aa24412fcc19e7
  REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5
  REACT_APP_JSON_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
  ```

- **JSON Server**: Used to save and retrieve favorite cities data locally. Ensure it is running on port 3001 as specified in the .env file.

- **CSS Styling**: The project uses standard CSS for styling components. Make adjustments in the src/styles/ folder as needed.

### Troubleshooting

Issue: Favorite city is added multiple times

Solution: Check if the id of the favorite city is unique in db.json. If there are duplicates, remove them manually or prevent duplicates in the UI.
Issue: API Key Not Working

Solution: Verify that your OpenWeatherMap API key in the .env file is correct and not expired. You can generate a new one from OpenWeatherMap.
Issue: JSON Server not starting

Solution: Ensure you are in the src directory when starting JSON Server. Use the command npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001.
